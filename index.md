## Reason Of Existence

1. My fav Extension [HackBar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackbar/djmoeoifnlhjolebkehmpaocfnipknbh) moved to a paid model.
1. Feels like a lot of work look for site because can't remember their domains.
1. Can't find anything similar to [HackBar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hackbar/djmoeoifnlhjolebkehmpaocfnipknbh) that's free & OpenSource
1. Don't Trust the sites & can't check their code always.
1. Don't Trust google/fb & other analytics on those sites.
